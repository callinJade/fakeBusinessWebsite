            Ariel came to us three years ago to find a service dog. She suffers
            from glaucoma which renders her legally blind. She found Becky and
            took her home. They have now been working and living together
            happily for three years! The above picture displays them on a recent
            trip to the park.

          <p>
            This business was a spur of the moment decision. I was taking a walk
            around my neighborhood with my Dad one night. We had our two dogs
            with us and we met this nice old lady who wanted to pet one. I
            couldn't stop smiling when I saw how happy this lady was to pet a
            dog who she didn't even know. This was during a time in my life that
            I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it. I was
            researching and considering colleges, what degree(s) I should get,
            what classes to take, and what job I wanted. I knew that I always
            loved animals and wanted to do something with them, but the only
            jobs I could find were medical and sciency jobs. I didn't want to do
            anything medical, but all of the science options were mostly indoors
            and minimal interaction with the actual animals. That night, watching
            the lady pet my dog, I realized that I could do this and be happy. I
            could be like a matchmaker for people and animals. So I decided to
            make my own website and here we are. I hope that you can find your
            perfect match through us! Thank you for giving me and my staff a
            shot!

            Hi! I'm exicited to have you on my website and am looking forward to
            working with you. My name is Jade. I'm 16 and am looking to help
            connect people to their perfect support or service animal. I've
            taken on a different path than other support animal and service
            animal companies. I believe that all types of animals can help, not
            just dogs. Most companies stick to one animal, whether it's dogs,
            cats, or birds, but I've decided to take on all animals including
            lizards and snakes and guinea pigs, among the typical dogs and cats.
            I hope we can find you YOUR new best friend!
