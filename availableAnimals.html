  Bobby is an amazing Russian Blue cat! He has a very gentle and cuddly
  personality. He was certified as a support animal on April 5, 2018. He is
  ready for adoption and his job as a loving, caring cat to be there for you
  whether you struggle from anxiety or chronic depression and everything in
  between. He is low maintenance and does not shed a lot so you don't have to
  worry about that! He also shouldn't make your allergies act up. He really is a
  perfect companion for cat lovers!

  Irene is a sweet tempermented green-cheeked conure. They are very cuddly and
  playful. Irene is a 9 year old female but that is still relavtively young for
  a healthy green cheek conure. She is still active. Green-cheeked parrots can
  live to 30 years with proper care, though the average lifespan is typically 10
  years due to owner neglect. She can be a perfect service animal or a support
  animal. Irene is a highly intelligent bird that has learned to talk and can
  recognize and get help if her owner needs it. If you want to adopt her as a
  support animal, she is a perfect companion. Since she is a small bird,
  airplanes are more accepting towards her. She can be the perfect companion for
  any person! Just remember to play and pay attention to her!
